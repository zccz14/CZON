# KaTeX Formula Display Test

This is an inline formula test: $ E = mc^2 $.

This is a block-level formula test:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

This is another block-level formula test:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x
$$

This is a complex formula test:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

Formula test with cases:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Table formula:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
a & b & c \\
\hline
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{array}
$$

Matrix formula:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Formula test containing text:

$$
E = mc^2 \quad \text{where } m \text{ is mass and
    } c \text{ is the speed of light}
$$

Generalized Kelly formula:

$$
f^* = \argmax_f \sum_{i \in X} P_i \ln (1 + f \cdot R_i)
$$

Please ensure all the above formulas are displayed correctly.
