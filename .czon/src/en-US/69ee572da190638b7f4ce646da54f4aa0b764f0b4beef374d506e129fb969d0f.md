# CZON - AI-Native Markdown Content Engine

[> Website Demo](https://czon.zccz14.com/)

In the AI era, as website content creators, we can have a smarter content creation engine.

**Return to Content: Minimize Distractions, Focus on Writing**

Let documentation return to its essence, let writing return to tranquility.

First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down some content, but I might not have thought of a title for it yet, or formed a specific organization. I want an LLM to automatically help me generate titles, create summaries, categorize, navigate, and handle other organizational tasks.

Second, my study must be kept clean. I don't want complex configuration tools, fiddling with intricate documentation setups, or complicated structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, I get a headache. Now, CZON chooses to hide all configurations in the `.czon` directory, sweeping them into a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; CZON handles the rest. All other directories are your writing space; you can organize your Markdown files however you like.

**Return to Native Language: Write in Your Mother Tongue, Smoothly Build Multilingual Versions**

Life is short; I'm too lazy to translate. People can best express the depth of their thoughts when using their native language. But staying connected with the world is also necessary; I don't want to give up multilingual communication. So, I want a tool that lets me write in my mother tongue while allowing more people to see my content. Current i18n solutions not only require manual translation but also self-maintenance of content updates, which is too troublesome. I choose to use an LLM to handle translation for me, saving a lot of time and enabling one-click multilingual translation.

## Core Features

1. 🌍 **Automatic Multilingual Translation**: Uses AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while the content can be multilingual.
2. 💭 **Automatic Summary Extraction**: Uses AI to analyze and extract key points from the original text.
3. 🧭 **Intelligent Classification & Navigation**: Uses AI to generate site maps and navigation, insensitive to the location of source files.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

CZON includes a built-in SSG solution that can transform any git folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.

⚠️ Please note: CZON is not a professional Static Site Generator (SSG). It is an AI-powered Markdown content engine focused on content creation and management.

✅ CZON aims to simplify the content creation and publishing process, allowing users to focus on writing itself rather than being bogged down by complex configurations and tools.

❌ CZON does not provide complex theme customization or a plugin ecosystem. Instead, it focuses on using AI to enhance content quality and accessibility.

🔔 However, CZON can still generate static sites. If necessary, CZON can be used as a preprocessor and integrated with other SSG solutions to create personalized, aesthetically pleasing sites.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or above recommended, `npx` command required)
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) obtained, or an OPENAI-compatible API Key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from Git, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work within a folder already managed by Git:

Configure environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to the official OpenAI API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Uses the current directory as the source and outputs to the `.czon/dist` directory.

- You can specify the language versions to generate by using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- No need to configure the source language; CZON will auto-detect it.

```bash
npx czon@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```

**View more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx czon@latest
