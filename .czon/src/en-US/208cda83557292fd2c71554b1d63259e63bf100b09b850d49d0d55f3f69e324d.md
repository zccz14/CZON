# CZON - Minimalist Markdown + AI Static Site Builder

[> Website Demo](https://czon.zccz14.com/)

## Core Features

1. 📃 **Static Site Generation**: Build any Git folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.
2. 🧭 **Intelligent Categorization & Navigation**: Uses AI to analyze content, generating site maps and navigation that are agnostic to source file locations.
3. 🌍 **Automatic Incremental Translation**: Uses AI for incremental translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while supporting multilingual audiences.

Why create another Markdown static site generator? I've reconsidered how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content**: Minimize distractions, focus on writing

  Let documents return to their essence, and let writing return to tranquility.

  First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down content, but I might not have thought of a title yet or formed a specific organization. I want LLMs to automatically generate titles, create summaries, categorize, navigate, and handle other organizational tasks.

  Second, my workspace must stay clean. I don't want complex build tools, complicated documentation configurations, or intricate structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, I get a headache. Now, CZON chooses to hide all configurations in the `.czon` directory, tucked away in a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; CZON handles the rest. All other directories are your writing space, where you can freely organize your Markdown files.

- **Return to Native Language**: Write in your native language, smoothly build multilingual versions

  Life is short; I'm too lazy to translate. People think most deeply when using their native language. Yet staying connected to the world is essential, and I don't want to give up multilingual communication. So, I wanted a tool that lets me write in my native language while allowing more people to see my content. Current i18n solutions require manual translation and content update maintenance, which is too cumbersome. I chose to use LLMs to handle translation, saving me time and enabling one-click multilingual translation.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or higher recommended, with `npx` command available)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) obtained, or an OPENAI-compatible API Key
- Git installed (used to list Markdown files from Git, ignoring files filtered by `.gitignore` rules)

First, work in a folder already managed by Git:

Set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to OpenAI's official API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model
```

Build the site with support for multilingual translation. Uses the current directory as the source and outputs to the `.czon/dist` directory.

- Specify language versions to generate by using the `--lang` parameter multiple times (e.g., `--lang zh-Hans --lang en-US`).
- No need to configure the source language; CZON automatically detects it.

```bash
npx czon@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US
```

**View more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx czon@latest
