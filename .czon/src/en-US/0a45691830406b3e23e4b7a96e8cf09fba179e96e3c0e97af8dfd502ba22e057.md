"title": "CZON Document Date Declaration Tips"
"summary": "This article introduces a usage tip for the CZON document system: declaring dates directly within the document body. Unlike traditional Markdown documents, which require date declaration via YAML Frontmatter (which can easily lead to recognition failure if the field is forgotten), CZON supports free-format date declarations within the body (e.g., 'Today is January 8, 2026'). The AI will automatically extract and infer the date information to use as the document's creation date. This method is more flexible and intelligent, avoiding Frontmatter field memorization issues and improving the user experience. Furthermore, documents with dates can generate timeline views, making them suitable for content types like diaries and blogs that require timeline management."

# Usage Tips

## Declaring Dates in the Document Body

You can use date declarations like "Today is January 8, 2026" within the document body (free format style). CZON will automatically recognize and process them.

Traditional Markdown documents declare dates via YAML Frontmatter, requiring you to remember the corresponding field; otherwise, the date may not be correctly recognized.

CZON supports declaring dates directly within the document body, avoiding the issue of forgetting to fill in Frontmatter fields.

The AI will automatically extract and infer date information from the body and process it as the document's creation date.

This method is more flexible and intelligent, enhancing the user experience.

As a side note, documents with dates can generate timeline views, making browsing and management easier. This is especially suitable for content types like diaries and blogs that benefit from timeline organization.
