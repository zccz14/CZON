# Usage Tips

## Declaring Dates in the Body Text

You can use date declarations like "Today is January 8, 2026" directly in the body text (formatting style is flexible), and CZON will automatically recognize and process it.

Traditional Markdown documents declare dates via YAML Frontmatter, which requires remembering the corresponding field; otherwise, the date may not be correctly identified.

CZON supports directly declaring dates in the body text, eliminating the problem of forgetting to fill in Frontmatter fields.

AI automatically extracts and infers date information from the body text and processes it as the document's creation date.

This approach is more flexible and intelligent, enhancing the user experience.

As a side note, documents with dates can generate timeline views, making browsing and management easier. This is particularly suitable for content types like diaries and blogs that benefit from a timeline.
