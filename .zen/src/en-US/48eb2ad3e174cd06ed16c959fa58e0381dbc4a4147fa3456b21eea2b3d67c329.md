Why create another Markdown static site generator? I've rethought how documentation tools can better serve writers in the AI era:

- **Return to Content**: Minimize distractions, focus on writing

  Let documentation return to its essence, let writing return to tranquility.

  First, I don't want to be a librarian. Sometimes I want to jot down some content, but I might not have thought of its title yet, or haven't formed a specific organization. I hope LLMs will automatically help me generate titles, create summaries, categorize, navigate, and handle other organizational tasks.

  Second, my study must be kept clean. I don't want complex build tools, fiddling with intricate documentation configurations, or complicated structures. Every time I see the configuration files and project structures of tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or Astro, I get a headache. Now, ZEN chooses to hide all configurations in the `.zen` directory, sweeping them into a corner. Users only need to focus on writing content; everything else is handled by ZEN. All other directories are your writing space; you can organize your Markdown files however you like.

- **Return to Native Language**: Write in your native language, smoothly build multilingual versions

  Life is short; I'm too lazy to translate. People can best express the depth of their thinking when using their native language. But staying connected with the world is also necessary; I don't want to give up multilingual communication. So, I want a tool that lets me write in my native language while allowing more people to see my content. Current i18n solutions not only require you to translate yourself but also maintain content updates, which is too troublesome. I choose to use LLMs to help with translation, saving me a lot of time and enabling one-click multilingual translation.

## Core Features

1. **Static Site Generation**
   - Build any folder containing Markdown files into a static HTML site.

2. **Intelligent Navigation**
   - Generate site maps and navigation. You don't need to maintain the original directory structure of the Markdown source files; you can move source files around freely.

3. **Incremental i18n Translation**
   - Use LLMs for incremental i18n translation, allowing users to write Markdown in their native language while the site can be multilingual.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalism**: Minimal configuration, maximum flexibility.
- **Content-First**: Focus on writing, not tool configuration.
- **AI-Powered**: Leverage AI for translation and content organization.
- **Cross-Language**: Support multilingual content creation and display.

## Quick Start

### Recommended Usage

**It is recommended that users switch to the directory containing Markdown files and directly use the following command to start building:**

```bash
# Set environment variables (modify according to your actual situation)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"  # Required: Please replace with your OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional, defaults to the official OpenAI API
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional, defaults to the gpt-3.5-turbo model

# Build the site, supporting multilingual translation
npx zengen@latest build --lang zh-Hans --lang en-US --verbose
```

**View more parameters or help**:

```bash
npx zengen
```

**Note**: ZEN enforces using the current directory as the source directory and outputs to the `.zen/dist` directory. It does not support specifying source and output directory parameters.
